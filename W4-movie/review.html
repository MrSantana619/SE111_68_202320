        <p><em>Grease</em> is a <i>Romantic Musical</i> set in the backdrop of the <b>1950s.</b> Danny and Sandy fall in <strong>love</strong> during the summer and then they parts way thinking they won't ever see each other again. Only to find out they end up reunited at the same school. When tbey finally meet each other again Danny acts all<i>"cool"</i> in front of his friends only to upset Sandy because the Danny she knows is a sweet one. He spends a majority of the movie trying to win her back only to succeed at the <b>end</b> of the movie.</p>

        <p>The concept is pretty cool as it's set in the 50's. It being a musical, it has really catchy songs, and it's beautifully choregraphed. It's one of those movies that I can't get tired off and have watched countless times. John Travolta and Olivia Newton-john do a beautiful job of playing a cat and mouse game to catchy tunes they sing. Overall i think it's a great movie and a classic in my opinion and deserves a watch if you have never seen it. </p>
